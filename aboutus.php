                    Skyline is a dedicated breeder of Giant Schnauzers located on Long Island, New York (NY). Our dogs
                    are a big part of our family. The family consists of my husband Bill, myself Tonilyn, our son
                    Nicholas and our daughter Taylor. The dogs take an active role in our family as well. They are great
                    protectors, companions, and beautiful specimens of the breed. I strive to best meet the standard
                    with my dogs and continue to want to improve and better the breed. First and foremost, I breed for
                    temperament, health, and conformation. Of course the Giant Schnauzer has a natural ability to have a
                    working drive and we make sure it is put to use.

                    In 2000 I purchased my first Giant Schnauzer and my love for this breed has blossomed from there! I
                    enjoy their extreme intelligence and their intense devotion to their families. There is so much to
                    learn and I continue to do so in my pursuit to improve the breed through constant researching of
                    health, pedigrees, and combining different bloodlines to produce the best dogs possible!

                    occasionally available. We provide the utmost in quality breeding. Our Giants are well socialized
                    dogs. We start them from when they are very young. They grow up to be great protectors as well as
                    fabulous companions. At Skyline Giants, we pride ourselves in breeding sound, healthy, well
                    socialized Giants and it shows in their personalities and dispositions. We take great care in

                    parents. All pet/companion puppies are placed with a spay/neuter contract and a limited registration

                    I have learned a lot about the many aspects of the breed and will continue to learn more throughout
                    my life with these dogs. I enjoy showing our dogs, but most of all we enjoy having them in our home
                    and part of our family. We are dedicated to improving the breed and will work hard towards that
                    goal.
